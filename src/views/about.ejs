            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Risks and Dangers</h2>
            <p> The main problems of the application end up being characteristics that the users themselves can exploit,
                either through the practice of illegal activities, the creation of multiple accounts to create false reports in periods
                very short periods, being victims of other users who only post negative comments, and a lack of commitment to the
                purpose of the project: to recover pets that are outside their home.
                
                With that in mind, the application should develop security measures such as the moderation of comments and reports with
                the help of a developer, the implementation of the "only one account per email" rule, the deactivation or
                verification of stored reports after a certain time limit and the mandatory requirement to have an account
                registered by the page to access the functionalities of the application. Although the above ideas do not eliminate the problem, they can always minimize the damage.
